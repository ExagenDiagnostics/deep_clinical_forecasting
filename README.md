# Deep Clinical Forecasting

The code within this repo provides a simple regime to build, train, and test the final deep learning model described in "Forecasting Outcomes in Rheumatoid Arthritis Using Longitudinal Deep Learning on Electronic Health Record Data", Norgeot 2018.

### Brief Abstract
We used structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, derived from rheumatology clinics at two distinct health systems (an academic health center and public safety net hospital) with different EHR platforms, to build a deep learning model that would predict future Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) disease activity. Our results indicate that it is possible to build accurate models that generalize across hospitals with different EHR systems and diverse patient populations of only a few hundred patients.
